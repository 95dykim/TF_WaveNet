# Dataset
I have used the following albums as a training dataset:
- The Arrogant Sons of Bitches - Three Cheers for Disappointment
- Bomb the Music Industry! - Album Minus Band
- Bomb the Music Industry! - Goodbye Cool World!
- Bomb the Music Industry! - Get Warmer
- Bomb the Music Industry! - Scrambles
- Bomb the Music Industry! - Vacation
- Jeff Rosenstock - I Look Like Shit
- Jeff Rosenstock - We Cool?
- Jeff Rosenstock - WORRY.
- Jeff Rosenstock - POST-
- Jeff Rosenstock - NO DREAM
- Jeff Rosenstock - SKA DREAM

You can download all of them for free from a website of Jeff Rosenstock's record label, [Quote Unquote Records](http://www.quoteunquoterecords.com/).

If you're planning to use the same dataset as I did or simply liked the music, then consider supporting him by buying the albums or donating to the label!

# Dataset
I have used the following albums as a training dataset:
- Three Cheers for Disappointment by The Arrogant Sons of Bitches
- Album Minus Band by Bomb the Music Industry!
- Goodbye Cool World! by Bomb the Music Industry!
- Get Warmer by Bomb the Music Industry!
- Scrambles by Bomb the Music Industry!
- Vacation by Bomb the Music Industry!
- I Look Like Shit by Jeff Rosenstock
- We Cool? by Jeff Rosenstock
- WORRY. by Jeff Rosenstock
- POST- by Jeff Rosenstock
- NO DREAM by Jeff Rosenstock
- SKA DREAM by Jeff Rosenstock

You can download all of them for free from a website of Jeff Rosenstock's record label, [Quote Unquote Records](http://www.quoteunquoterecords.com/).

If you're planning to use the same dataset I used or simply liked the music, then consider supporting him by buying the albums or donating to the label!
